https://github.com/kingan/binarygap

Steps.

Convert an integer to its binary representation

Use regular expressions on the binary variable to find the index of all 1's

Create bigrams from the list of indexes

Map the bigrams back to segment the binary representation

Calculate the length of the binary gap for each segment

If the array exists, return the max length, else return 0
